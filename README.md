# Extract Text & Diagrams from PDFs

### Purpose
> When using tools like ChatGPT or NotebookLM for summarizing or explaining university lectures (PDFs) provided by universities, there is often an issue that all the content that is in the form of images (diagrams, etc) gets ignored by these tools unless you manually take screenshot of the page and use an online OCR which would have limits. So, this program will simplify your task by helping you extract complete text and all diagrams from PDFs.
