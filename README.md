# pdf-text-images â€” Extract Text & Diagrams from PDFs

> Extracts complete text from PDF, even from images inside it, and saves images/diagrams separately.

#### Why did I make it?

When using tools like **ChatGPT** or **NotebookLM** for summarizing or explaining university **lectures** (PDFs) provided by **universities**, there is often an issue that all the content that is in the form of images (diagrams, etc) gets ignored by these tools unless you manually take screenshot of the page and use an online OCR which would have limits. So, this program will simplify your task by helping you extract complete text and all diagrams from PDFs.

## Usage

### 1. Installation
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mafgit/pdf-text-images
```

### 2. Import & Example
```py
from pdf_text_images import convert, convert_multi

text = convert_multi(
    ['IS_Week # 2.pdf', 'IS_Week # 3.pdf', 'IS_Week # 3.pdf'],
     min_chars=0 # FORCE OCR FOR EVERY PAGE
     save_images=True,
)
```

### 3. Convert Single PDF
```py
def convert(
    filepath: str, 
    min_chars=512, 
    save_images=False, 
    save_text_file=True, 
    langs=['eng']
) -> str
```

Args:
- filepath (str): Path to PDF file
- min_chars (int): If no. of characters in a page that are directly extractable are less than min_chars, it would be processed using OCR, otherwise it would just be extracted simply. Use 0 if you want to force OCR for all page.
- save_images (bool): If true, every image (e.g. diagram) found inside each page will be saved in output folder in the format <page_num>_<img_no>.<img_text>
- langs (List[str]): List of languages used in PDF in order of importance for OCR (you should have language packs installed if you add other languages)
- save_text_file (bool)

### 4. Convert Multiple PDFs
```py
def convert_multi(
    filepaths: List[str], single_text_file=True,
    **kwargs
) -> str
```

- filepath (str): Path to PDF file
- single_text_file (bool): If true, all textual content will be stored in a single .txt file instead of separate files 
- min_chars (int): If no. of characters in a page that are directly extractable are less than min_chars, it would be processed using OCR, otherwise it would just be extracted simply. Use 0 if you want to force OCR for all page.
- save_images (bool): If true, every image (e.g. diagram) found inside each page will be saved in output folder in the format <page_num>_<img_no>.<img_text>
- langs (List[str]): List of languages used in PDF in order of importance for OCR (you should have language packs installed if you add other languages)
- save_text_file (bool)

## Requirements
